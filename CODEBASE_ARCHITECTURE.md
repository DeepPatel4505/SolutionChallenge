# Codebase Architecture Summary

## Overview
This is a B2B Knowledge Management platform with:
- **Team collaboration**: Organizations → Teams (Groups) → Members
- **Transcript processing**: Audio/video/documents → (Deepgram/text extraction) → Structured data + RAG embeddings
- **Content sharing**: Role-based permissions (organization-level and team-level)
- **AI services**: RAG-based Q&A, summaries, analysis tools

---

## 1. TRANSCRIPT HANDLING

### Database Schema
**Core tables** (from `migration.sql` + `b2b_migration.sql`):
- `lectures` (main transcript store)
  - `id`, `user_id`, `title`, `status`
  - `audio_url` (Supabase Storage URL)
  - `transcript_text` (full plain text)
  - `transcript_json` (structured: utterances, speaker labels, timestamps, duration, word count)
  - `summary_text` (cached summary)
  - `org_id`, `group_id` (ownership/scoping)
  - `created_at`

- `lecture_chunks` (RAG embeddings)
  - `id`, `lecture_id`, `chunk_text`
  - `embedding` (vector(768) from Cohere or pgvector(1024))

- `lecture_analysis` (cached analyses)
  - `lecture_id`, `analysis_type`, `content`

### Processing Pipeline
**File upload flow** (`routers/lectures.py` → `_upload_and_process_lecture`):
1. **Upload**: File → Supabase Storage (`lecture-audio`) → Public URL
2. **Transcribe** (status: "transcribing")
   - **Audio/Video**: Deepgram API (nova-2) with:
     - Speaker diarization (multi-speaker detection)
     - Word-level timestamps
     - Utterance-level timestamps
     - Language detection
     - Punctuation/smart formatting
     - Returns: `transcript_text`, `utterances[]`, `speaker_labels{}`, `duration_seconds`, `word_count`
   - **Documents** (PDF/DOCX/PPTX): Text extraction (no OCR) → treated as transcript
3. **Summarize** (status: "summarizing")
   - Groq API generates summary (cached in `lecture_analysis`)
4. **RAG Processing** (status: "processing_rag")
   - Chunk transcript (~500-800 tokens, overlapping)
   - Generate embeddings via Cohere API (embed-english-v3.0, 1024-dim vectors)
   - Store in `lecture_chunks` table
5. **Complete** (status: "completed")

### Access Control
```python
# From chat.py and analysis.py (same logic)
- Personal lecture (no org_id):     only uploader can access
- Workspace lecture (org_id only):  any org member can access
- Team lecture (org_id + group_id): team members + org admins/owner can access
```

---

## 2. TEAM/ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE

### Database Schema
**Organizations (Workspaces)**:
- `organizations` table
  - `id`, `name`, `owner_id`, `subscription_tier` (free/pro/enterprise), `subscription_status`
  
- `org_members` table
  - `org_id`, `user_id`, `role` (owner/admin/member), `joined_at`
  - Unique constraint: (org_id, user_id)

**Teams/Groups**:
- `groups` table
  - `id`, `org_id`, `name`, `description`, `created_by`, `created_at`
  
- `group_members` table
  - `group_id`, `user_id`, `role` (admin/member), `joined_at`
  - Unique constraint: (group_id, user_id)

### Hierarchy
```
Workspace (Organization)
├── Member (org_members table)
│   ├── Role: owner, admin, or member
│   └── Can be in multiple Teams
└── Team (Groups)
    └── Team Members (group_members table)
        └── Role: admin or member
```

### Role Permissions

**Organization Level**:
- **Owner**: Can create/delete org, invite/remove members, manage admins
- **Admin**: Can create teams, invite members to org, manage team memberships
- **Member**: Can view workspace and assigned teams

**Team Level**:
- **Admin**: Can add/remove members from team
- **Member**: Can view and access team content

**Cross-role logic** (from `group_service.py`):
- Org owner/admin automatically get team admin role if added to a team
- Org admins can manage all team content
- Regular members need explicit team membership

---

## 3. SHARING & PERMISSIONS SYSTEM

### Implementation
All permission checks in backend routers use:
- `_can_access_lecture(lecture: dict, user_id: str) → bool`
  - Checks org membership + team membership rules
  - Used by: `chat.py`, `analysis.py`, `lectures.py`

### Sharing Flow
1. **Upload with scope**:
   - Personal: `org_id=None, group_id=None` → private
   - Workspace: `org_id=<id>, group_id=None` → all org members
   - Team: `org_id=<id>, group_id=<id>` → team members only

2. **Access endpoints** enforced:
   - `/api/lectures` - list (filtered by access)
   - `/api/lectures/{id}/chat` - Q&A (access check)
   - `/api/analysis/*` - analysis tools (access check)

3. **No explicit sharing API** - instead, move content to team:
   - Upload directly to `org_id + group_id`
   - Or modify existing lecture (if user has permission)

---

## 4. UI FOR SHARING/COLLABORATION

### Frontend Pages

**Organizations** (`frontend/src/app/(protected)/organizations/page.tsx`):
- List all workspaces (user's memberships)
- Filter by role (owner, admin, member)
- Create workspace
- Delete workspace (owner only)
- Navigate to "Workspace Details" or "Add/Upload to Team"

**Groups** (`frontend/src/app/(protected)/groups/page.tsx`):
- List teams in selected workspace
- Filter/search teams
- Create team (org admin/owner only)
- Navigate to team details
- No direct add-members UI here

**Workspace View** (`frontend/src/app/(protected)/workspace-view/[id]/page.tsx`):
- Shows all lectures in workspace (filtered by team if selected)
- Team selector dropdown
- Date filter for activity
- View lecture status (uploading, processing, completed, failed)
- Grouped by date bucket (Today, Yesterday, etc.)
- Upload new lecture to workspace/team
- **This is the main hub for uploading content to teams**

**Lecture Details** (`frontend/src/app/(protected)/lecture/[id]/page.tsx`):
- View transcript (with speaker labels, timestamps, utterances)
- Chat interface (RAG-based Q&A)
- Analysis tools: Summary, Notes, Keywords, Questions, Topics, Highlights
- Translation support (Hinglish, Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil, Bengali)
- Export to PDF, Markdown, TXT, JSON
- Flashcard viewer (auto-generated from analysis)

### No explicit "Share to Team" UI in current version
- Instead: **Upload → Select org_id + group_id** during upload
- Or: **Manage team memberships** to control access to existing team lectures

## 6. KEY APIS FOR "SUGGEST TEAMS" FEATURE

### To suggest teams to add a lecture to:

**User's teams in organization**:
```
GET /api/groups/org/{org_id}  (org admin/owner see all)
→ Returns: [{ id, org_id, name, description, created_at, ... }]
```

**Team members (to check if user fits)**:
```
GET /api/groups/{group_id}/members
→ Returns: [{ id, user_id, role, joined_at, users: { email } }]
```

**User's role in org** (to restrict suggestions):
```
GET /api/organizations/{org_id}/role
→ Returns: { role: "owner" | "admin" | "member" }
```

**Org members** (to find related people):
```
GET /api/organizations/{org_id}/members
→ Returns: [{ id, org_id, user_id, role, joined_at, users: { email }, groups: [...] }]
```

### Suggestion Strategy Options:

1. **Teams with related members**: Find teams containing colleagues who are in same org
2. **Search by team name/description**: Let user filter teams
3. **Activity-based**: Suggest teams most recently active
4. **Role-based**: Admins see all teams, members only see their teams
5. **Content similarity**: (Future) Analyze lecture content, suggest teams by topic

### Database queries to enable suggestions:

```sql
-- Teams where user is member (can always suggest these)
SELECT g.* FROM groups g
JOIN group_members gm ON g.id = gm.group_id
WHERE gm.user_id = ? AND g.org_id = ?;

-- All teams in org (for org admins)
SELECT * FROM groups WHERE org_id = ?;

-- Team with common members
SELECT g.*, COUNT(gm.user_id) as shared_members FROM groups g
JOIN group_members gm ON g.id = gm.group_id
WHERE g.org_id = ? AND gm.user_id IN (
    SELECT gm2.user_id FROM group_members gm2
    WHERE gm2.group_id IN (
        SELECT g2.id FROM groups g2
        JOIN group_members gm3 ON g2.id = gm3.group_id
        WHERE gm3.user_id = ? AND g2.org_id = ?
    )
)
GROUP BY g.id
ORDER BY shared_members DESC;
```

## 8. CURRENT GAPS FOR "SUGGEST TEAMS" FEATURE

1. **No suggestion ranking logic** in backend
   - Could add endpoint: `POST /api/groups/{org_id}/suggestions?lecture_id=X`
   - Returns ranked list based on: user membership, member overlap, recent activity, topic similarity

2. **No explicit sharing/assignment endpoint**
   - Workaround: Upload with `org_id + group_id` or re-upload
   - Could add: `POST /api/lectures/{id}/assign-to-team` to move lecture between teams

3. **UI doesn't show suggested teams during upload**
   - Upload flow selects `org_id` + `group_id` manually
   - Could enhance: Show recommended teams after org selection

4. **No viewing team context when uploading**
   - Could show team descriptions, member count, recent activity
   - Help user choose right team
